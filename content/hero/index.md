I'm a Mern Stack developer with a goal-driven creative mindset and passion for learning and innovating.

Currently working as Campus Mantri at [GFG](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) and as a coordinator at [GDSC LPU](https://gdsc.community.dev/lovely-professional-university-jalandhar/).

Outside work, I occasionally create amateur React-apps [Codesendbox](https://codesandbox.io/u/parmarroopshreeudaywal).
